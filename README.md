# unified-wal
A shell script for using pywal colour schemes in KDE plasma

make sure [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) and [plasma-theme](https://github.com/maldoinc/plasma-theme-switcher) are installed and in PATH before using, I haven't made any sort of error handling yet so if it breaks who knows why
try editing my bad code to un-supress the qdus errors and see if that helps

progress:
- [x] [pywal wrapper](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
- [x] [plasma-theme wrapper](https://github.com/maldoinc/plasma-theme-switcher)
- [ ] better input handling
- [ ] gtk theme support via [wpgtk](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk)
- [ ] discord theme support (maybe, don't count on it)
